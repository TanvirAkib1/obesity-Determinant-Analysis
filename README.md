# A Data Mining Approach to Discover Significant Determinants of Obesity

This repository contains the research paper, dataset, and implementation code for our project **"A Data Mining Approach to Discover Significant Determinants of Obesity"**.

### 📄 About the Project
This study builds an end-to-end **data mining and machine learning pipeline** to identify major determinants of obesity using a survey dataset of 2,111 records.

### ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- MySQL (for data storage)
- Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM

### 📊 Key Results
- **Random Forest** achieved the best generalization with **Accuracy = 0.9527, F1 = 0.9514**
- Determinants hierarchy: **Weight → Height → Age / FCVC → (FAF, TUE, CH2O, NCP)**
- Explainability through **Permutation Feature Importance (PFI)**
